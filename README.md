This is a Classroom Management System which consists of 5 tables and 3 different types of relationships. Table names and relationships are below.
Students - Courses --> Many to many
Students - User_Accounts --> One to one
Courses - Exercises --> One to many
Students_courses a foreign key table for Students and Courses tables.
Even though I started the API part, I wasn't able to finish the project because of work related issues.
